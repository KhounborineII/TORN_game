## TORN GAME

This project is a basic Kernal game written in Rust based off of a Pluggable Interrupt Template
by [Gabriel Ferrer](https://github.com/gjf2a/demo_game) using [Pluggable Interrupt OS](https://crates.io/crates/pluggable_interrupt_os).

It is a simple game based on the movie TRON. The player is tasked to eliminate enemies in a similar way
to Snakes. Let the enemies hit your line while you avoid their's and the wall. The more you eliminate,
the more points you will accumulate!

Enjoy the simple experience that is TORN!

## NOTE: STILL WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
